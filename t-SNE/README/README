Each script is described below with a sample command to run
the script.

Input file for all the scripts below is tsv file of top 25% most variant
alternative splicing events.


tSNE_BI_only_adjusted.py: performs t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding
                          only on cell lines tagged with BI (Broad Institute).
                          "Adjusted" indicates that script has option to adjust
                          events that meet a threshold for non-PSI values. Non-PSI
                          are replaced with the the median PSI value for that event.
                          Data is centered by converting PSI values to Z-scores.

                        python tSNE_BI_only_adjusted.py -i /path/to/input/file --nonPSI 0.01

        tSNE_BI_only.py: performs t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding only on
                        cell lines tagged with BI (Broad Institute).
                        Does not adjust for events with non-PSI values
                        and therefore, only selects for events that has
                        a [numerical] value for each cell line.

                        python tSNE_BI_only.py -i /path/to/input/file

tSNE_fh_only_adjusted.py: performs t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor
                          Embedding only on cell lines tagged with
                          fh (Firehose). "Adjusted" indicates that script
                          has option to adjust events that meet a threshold
                          for non-PSI values. Non-PSI values are replaced
                          with the the median PSI value for that event.
                          Data is centered by converting PSI values to
                          Z-scores.

                         a [numerical] value for each cell line.

tSNE_tissue_outlier_adjusted.py: performs t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding
                                on all cell lines regardless of tags.
                                "Adjusted" indicates that script has option
                                to adjust events that meet a threshold for
                                non-PSI values. Non-PSI values are replaced
                                with the the median PSI value for that event.
                                Data is centered by converting PSI values to
                                Z-scores.

tSNE_tissue_outlier.py: performs t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding
                        on all cell lines regardless of tags.
                        Does not adjust for events with non-PSI values

tSNE_visualize_non_PSI.py:  performs t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding
                           on all cell lines regardless of tag, but this script
                           is used to visualize cell lines that have the highest number
                           of non-PSI values across all events. Cell lines in red are in
                           the 90th percentile for most number of non-PSI values.

                           python tSNE_visualize_non_PSI.py -i /path/to/input/file --v_nonPSI 0.01
